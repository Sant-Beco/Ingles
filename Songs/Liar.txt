What do you want from me? Just let me breathe a little
What do you want to see? Me ni nieeru mono?
What do you want to believe? Still nothing can be settled
Hold on your words you say it´s no good.

Don´t know

Hey liar, hey liar
What do you think of living without me?
Hey liar, hey liar

Hey liar, hey liar
What do you think of living without me?
Hey liar, hey liar

Must be a dream i see i 
Trying so hard to know inside of you
Staring your eyes to feel
so cold
so cold

Hey liar, hey liar
are 
i´m tired, so tired
what do you think of living without me?
