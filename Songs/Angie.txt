Angie, Angie
When will those clouds all disappear?
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?
With no loving in our coats
You can´t say we´re satisfied
But Angie, Angie
You can´t say we never tried.

Angie, you´re beautiful
But ain´t it time we said goodbye?
Angie, I still love you 
Remember all those nights we cried?
All the dreams we held so close
Let me whisper in you ear

Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?

Oh, Angie, don't you weep
All your kisses still taste sweet
I hate sadness in your eyes
Angie, Angie
ain´t it time we said goodbye? Yeah
ain´t it time we said goodbye?
