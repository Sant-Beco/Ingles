Angie, Angie
When will those clouds all disappear?
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?
With no loving in our coats
You can´t say we´re satisfied
But Angie, Angie
You can´t say we never tried.

Angie, you´re beautiful
But ain´t it time we said goodbye?
Angie, I still love you 
Remember all those nights we cried?
All the dreams we held so close
Let me whisper in you ear

Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?

Oh, Angie, don't you weep
All your kisses still taste sweet
I hate sadness in your eyes
Angie, Angie
ain´t it time we said goodbye? Yeah
ain´t it time we said goodbye?

With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats 
You can´t say we´re satisfied
But Angie, I still love you, baby
Everywhere I look, I see your eyes
There aint´t a woman that comes close to you 
Come on, baby, dry your eyes

But Angie, Angie
Ain´t it good to be alive?
Angie, Angie
They can´t say we never tried
