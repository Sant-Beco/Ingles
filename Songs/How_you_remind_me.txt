Never made it as a wise man
I couldn´t cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I´m sick of sight without a sense of feeling 
And this is how you remind me.

This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It´s not like you say sorry 
I was waiting on a different story
This time I´m mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking 
And I´ve been wrong, I´ve been down 
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream: Are we having fun yet?

Yet, yet, yet, no, no
yet, yet, yet, no, no

It´s not like you didn´t know that 
I said I love you and I swear I still do 
And it must have been so bad 
´Cause living with me must´ve damn near killed you 

And this is how you remid me
Of what I really me
This is how you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad 
´Cause living with me must´ve damn near killed you

And this is how you remind me
Of what i really am
This is how remind me 
Of what i really am

It´s not like you to say sorry 
I was waiting on a different story
this time I´m mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And l´ve been wrong, l´ve been down 
Been to the bottom of every bottle 
These five words in my head 
Scream: Are we having fun yet?

Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no

Never made it as a wise man
I couldn´t cut it as a poor man stealing
And this is how you remind me 
This is how you remind me 

This is how you remind me 
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me 
Of what I really am

It´s not like to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I´m mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I´ve been wrong, I´ve down 
Been to the bottom on every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream: Are having fun yet?

Yet, yet
Are we having fun yet?
Yet, yet
Are we having fun yet?
Yet, yet
Are we having fun yet?
Yet, yet
